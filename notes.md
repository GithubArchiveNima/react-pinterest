# W8 D3: React - Next Steps

REACT: INTO DARKNESS
REACT: GHOST PROTOCOL
REACT: 2 FAST 2 REACT
REACT: 2 SLOW
REACT: NEXT GENERATION

What's today's goal?

Taking a look at things to do "next".

- I don't know exactly what we're doing
    - be prepared to see me debug stuff
- Software dev cycle with a React project

E.g.

- Let's clone a pre-existing website (e.g. YouTube, Pinterest, etc...)
- Styled Components - example of a React library
- working with third party component libraries
    - some choices here...
- React.Context API
    - if we get to this... it MIGHT go over your head.
    - sharing state between components
    - Dealing with a user session
    - light/dark mode
- Using React Router
- class components
- generators for projects



Nima's General Tips:

- User stories (what IS your project?)
    - engaging with stakeholders
    - user interviews
- Wireframes (what will it look like?)
    - Mockups/designs
        - both on mobile and desktop
        - what each possible screen looks like
        - What each component looks like in different states
- Maybe you can use a template (prebuild layout/components)
- Maybe you can use a generator (premade project)

"It feels like everything has to be locked down before you start"
"React makes a lot of sense because I come from a design background, because the way you build out the wireframes is that you build them in components already"

-> How would we design for React 360?

    - We see a list of pins by "pinners" that we follow

    - Header (Logo)
    - Container (Pins)
        - 6 columns
        - maybe build this on our own w/ a function that splits our content into 6 diff arrays.
    - Pin:
        - unique height b/c of the image, b/c text content
        - image
        - likes
        - heart icon to control the "likes"
        - repins
        - the Pinner's avatar, name
        - description
        - comments
            - hardcoded
            - each comment has an avatar and some text
        - there is no way to add a comment
